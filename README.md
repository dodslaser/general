Repo for scripts and code not belonging to specific flows

### csv2xls
Converts a csv file to an xlsx file for opening it into Excel.
Can read in multiple csv files and place them on separate worksheets in the same excel file.

### expansionhunter
Includes a small qsubscript for running expansionhunter manually. Mainly used to run expansionhunter on old wgs samples before it was implemented in WOPR on routine.
Formatting will probably not match WOPR routine and may need to be adjusted.
